## Core Java Concepts Practice  This repository contains small, focused programs demonstrating important Core Java concepts such as File Handling, Multithreading, Exception Handling, Encapsulatio, and Java IO/NIO APIs.
# Core Java Concepts

This repository contains well-structured and practical examples of **Core Java concepts**, created to strengthen fundamental understanding and support interview preparation.

The code focuses on clarity, correct usage of APIs, and real-world relevance rather than just theory.
